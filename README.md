# Music Releases
This is a single page application which shows new album and single releases. 
The app made with React.js framwork. 

* We made 5 components and mounted three of them (CoverImg, AlbumName & ArtistName) to AlbumList.jsx, and then we import Header and AlbumList to App.jsx.  
* We have one cover image and Album name and Artist name. 
* In the album we made a link to Spotify. And by Hovering on the cover image the icons are displaying.
* The play icon has an extra hovering effect (transform: scale(1.1)), making it bigger.
* The app is responsive showing 4 albums per row on desktop, 2 per row on tablet and 1 per row on mobile.


## The problem

Making props and connecting all files to the app and map function one of the biggest issues we struggled with. 
And for the CSS part, hovering and icons was not easy neither.  

We work in with in Agile methodology we were made our components and try to understand how the props can transfer all data to the other files. 

If we had more time we could work on responsive in different way, for example in phone size use img[2] and on tablet  img[1] and on the big screen use img[0].
